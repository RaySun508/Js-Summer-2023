// Declare and assign values to variables
let num1 = 5;
let num2 = 3;

// Calculate the product
let product = num1 * num2;

// Print the result
console.log("The product of num1 and num2 is: " + product);
// Declare and assign value to the radius variable
let radius = 2.5;

// Calculate the area using the exponentiation operator (**)
let area = Math.PI * (radius ** 2);

// Print the result
console.log("The area of the circle is: " + area);


//Assignment Operators quest 2 of HW.. 

// Declare and assign an initial value to the count variable
let count = 5;

// Use the addition assignment operator (+=) to add 2 to count
count += 2;

// Print the resulting value of count
console.log("The value of count is: " + count);

// Declare and assign an initial value to the price variable
let price = 10;

// Use the multiplication assignment operator (*=) to multiply price by 2.5
price *= 2.5;

// Print the resulting value of price
console.log("The value of price is: " + price);

//question 3 Comparison Operators

// Declare and assign number values to age1 and age2 variables
let age1 = 25;
let age2 = 30;

// Use the greater than operator (>) to compare age1 and age2
let isAge1GreaterThanAge2 = age1 > age2;

// Print the resulting boolean value
console.log("Is age1 greater than age2? " + isAge1GreaterThanAge2);

// Declare and assign a string value to the name variable
let name = "Alice";

// Use the not equal to operator (!=) to compare name with "John Doe"
let isNameNotEqualToJohnDoe = name != "John Doe";

// Print the resulting boolean value
console.log("Is name not equal to 'John Doe'? " + isNameNotEqualToJohnDoe);


//Question 4 Logical Operators

// Declare and assign boolean values to isMember and hasCoupon variables
let isMember = true;
let hasCoupon = false;

// Use the logical OR operator (||) to check eligibility for free shipping
let isEligibleForFreeShipping = isMember || hasCoupon;

// Print the resulting boolean value
console.log("Is the customer eligible for free shipping? " + isEligibleForFreeShipping);

// Declare and assign a number value to the num variable
let num = 10;

// Use the logical NOT operator (!) to check if num is not equal to 0
let isNotEqualToZero = !(num === 0);

// Print the resulting boolean value
console.log("Is num not equal to 0? " + isNotEqualToZero);


//conditional(ternary)

// Declare and assign a number value to the age variable
let age = 18;

// Use the conditional operator (ternary operator) to check if the person is old enough to vote
let message = age >= 18 ? "You are old enough to vote" : "You are not old enough to vote";

// Print the resulting message to the console
console.log(message);

// Declare and assign a number value to the price variable
let price = 25.99;

// Use the conditional operator (ternary operator) to check if the product is on sale
let saleStatus = price < 20 ? "The product is on sale" : "The product is not on sale";

// Print the resulting sale status to the console
console.log(saleStatus);
